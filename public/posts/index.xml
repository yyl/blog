      <description>&lt;p&gt;I created yet another blog to write stuff. Here is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/blog_screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;What does my blog look like&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The blog is created using Hugo, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages via Github. Both are free. This blog talks about what did I do to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hugo is a free tool that takes simple text I write and turns it into a blog website. To make it work, the text I write needs to follow a certain structure Hugo requires. The text also needs to be in Markdown, which is a writing syntax that adds formatting to plain texts. Cloudflare Pages is a platform to host the actual website I create on the Internet. Github is a platform to store code (or really anything digitally), track changes and open to others for e.g. sharing and collaboration. Some basic knowledge of the three tools would make reading the following a bit easier, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
