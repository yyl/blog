<li>&ldquo;particularly with the recent changes in rules and regulations around ATT, that the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/">more integration the better</a>. And so you see all this integration happening in the gaming space, so they can know who their customers are. It’s funny, again, Roblox feels so far ahead of things where everything is one experience to the extent that you’re allowed to have these distinct experiences that are not defined as different apps, they’re defined as being part of one app, which is great for you from a monetization perspective and from a user experience perspective.&rdquo;
