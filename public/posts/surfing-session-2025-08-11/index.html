Surf up a touch as some more NW swell shows today. Winds stay on the lighter side.
Touch more of the shorter-period NW swell moves in, setting up more thigh to waist high zone waves.
W winds stay on the lighter side all day, most favorable through mid-day, then puffing up a few more knots over the afternoon.
Condition:

Notes:

Surfed at The Creek at Linda Mar from 9:20 to 11:20

Looks like my stamina runs out after about 2 hours of surfing
I was at the far south area of The Creek, very close to the actual creek


Wave height goes from 3-4ft at 9am to 2-3ft at 12pm

The waves I come across today are prob ~2-3ft, maybe north side has higher waves
See below for a handy comparison of different wave heights


Primary swell ~3.2ft @ 9s at NW direction

NW is supposed to be an ideal swell direction here
This is more frequent than the one on 8/6 and I can attest it is less powerful and better for beginners like me


Wind goes from Onshore 1/3 NW to Onshore 8/8 WNW

Wind is indeed quite light at first and goes up later around 11, but still feels OK


Wave energy 138kJ to 173kJ: waves are powerful but feels weaker than those on 8/6

This is one of the greatest sessions I have ever had at Linda Mar, and possibly the best so far. I ride at least a dozen times in 2 hours. Previously at this beach I usually have trouble even paddle towards the wave because how frequent and strong waves are - they just keep beating me and my longboard back to the shore. But today somehow the waves just didn&rsquo;t knock me off. This is the first time I surfed at the creek, the most south spot at Linda Mar - usually I stay in front of Taco Bell - maybe this spot is more beginner friendly." />

<p>This is one of the greatest sessions I have ever had at Linda Mar, and possibly the best so far. I ride at least a dozen times in 2 hours. Previously at this beach I usually have trouble even paddle towards the wave because how frequent and strong waves are - they just keep beating me and my longboard back to the shore. But today somehow the waves just didn&rsquo;t knock me off. This is the first time I surfed at the creek, the most south spot at Linda Mar - usually I stay in front of Taco Bell - maybe this spot is more beginner friendly.</p>
<p>The waves are quite consistent the entire morning, giving me as well as a lot of other surfers ample change to catch them. I didn&rsquo;t realize the waves are as high as 4ft per the forecast - I would say it&rsquo;s closer to 2-3ft. Also the forecast initially said it was 1-2ft in the morning when I checked it the first time but I guess later on they updated.</p>
<p>Linda Mar is more crowded than Princeton Jetty - there are always 10+ people at one spot. Sitting in the crowd definitely helps. Watching them taking spots helps me choose the right spot, and if waves change places to break and others notice I can follow along.</p>
<p>One thing I experience several times is a drop of speed in the middle of a ride. It is almost like I am slowing down for the wave to catch up with me. I suspect it has something to do with me surfing out of the ideal surfing surface and lost the speed, but I don&rsquo;t know what caused it.</p>
<p>I also try to steer the board towards the direction the waves break but that just does not work for me yet - I end up usually fell out of balance.</p>
<p>I will definitely try the same spot under similar condition next time to see if I can get another good session!</p>
