## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "They more than doubled their ads revenue. That’s from a small base, and those numbers got leaked in the Wall Street Journal from their strategy meeting, they said it’d be like $9 billion in revenue by 2030. Okay, that’s not going to change the world, but that’s a pretty meaningful amount of money that’s basically all profit. So I think the pivot is complete, and I think they’re executing against the strategy, and I think the strategy is the right one now."

2. "those are the products that benefit the most from the research. So I’ll do the research and then I’ll go to united.com, I don’t need you to buy the thing and the lower intent the thing is, then the less it benefits from research, so I don’t need an agent to do that for me either. I can go to Instacart and set up recurring purchases already, I don’t really care. You could, okay, buy me toilet paper, there’s not a lot of risk there, but there’s also not a lot of value being generated in having that buy it on my behalf. It’s an easier thing to just instrument to set it up."
