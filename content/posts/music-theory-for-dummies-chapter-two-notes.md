- **A beat** is a pulsation that divides time into equal lengths.
	- Example: a ticking clock ticks 60 times in a minute, each of which is a beat!
- **tempo** defines how fast or slow a beat is, usually in the unit of Beats Per Minute (BPM)
- **A note** consists of (1). pitch: how high or low this sound is; (2). duration: how long this sound is
- **Time signature** is the pair of numbers usually at the beginning of the music sheet
	- The top number tells the number of beats in one measure/bar
	- The bottom number tells which note gets one beat
	- Combined they are used to indicate the structure of a piece of music
- **A measure/bar** is a segment in written music used as an unit that contains a fixed number of notes per time signature

What's confusing to me is that none of the elements discussed so far convey the complete information about the music's timing. Each contributes a specific piece. For example, tempo specifies exactly how many beats occur in a minute, but it doesn't tell us how many beats a particular note duration takes up. Each note has its own name (e.g., whole note, quarter note), and it is the time signature that indicates which note value receives one beat. Additionally, one needs the other number in the time signature to know how many beats there are in a measure for the music.
