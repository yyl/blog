This book was first publised in 2013, but I only get to finish it rather recently. There are plenty of reviews or overviews of what the book is about out there - it tells the modern history of America the nation between years of 1970 and 2010, in which the old institutions collapse and people struggle with the transition, through the life stories of various people at that time. It is a great book and it definitely gives me chills and questions more than hopes and answers.

What it gets me the most is that the transition hurts the average American (middle class) the most, and the nation still does not have answers to them now (2025). Characters in the book like Jeff (politician), Peter Thiel (tech billionaire) and even Dean Price (entrepreneur) each has their own struggle, but it is Tammy and the Hartzell family that represent the mass population - both are factory worker who used to enjoy the social stability and decent life brought from the factory job, and both got laid off during the deindustralization. 

40 years later today America as a country not only lost most of its factories and manufacture power, but also made the factory job bad enough both socially and economically that people who want a decent life would try to run away from. This change has a profound impact on the global power dynamics: nowadays America as a country cannot build anything - almost everything in the hands of American people are manufactured somewhere else. Sure American companies make great products (from iPhone to commercial airplanes), but they are only designed in America, not "Made in America" anymore. The manufactore power has been the greatest strength the America holds during WWII, but alas now it enjoys a service-oriented economy - the American people surely can buy a lot of stuff!

Now I don't pretend to be knowledgable on grand stuff like society, economy or geopolicy. One thing I do believe is that ultimately a country needs to build stuff in the physical world - build to grow, build to survive, and build to recover. How (when) does the America build?
