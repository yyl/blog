Somehow I have missed the investment update for July - This is the 7th post of the monthly family investment update. The post tracks the performance in the month of July, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

As mentioned in the [H1 retrospect]({{< ref "investment-retrospect-h1-2025.md" >}}), we have been using a wrong metric. The new metric records the investment performance of the month of July from **101.95** to **104.38**. 

A breakdown of growth by investment type is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | 2.39            | 
| After tax   | 2.38            | 
| 401(k)      | 2.42            | 

After tax and 401(k) portion are similar this month. They are also similar to the market performance - S&P index grows at 2.24% and NASDAQ Comp. at 3.72% ([source](https://ccmg.com/benchmark-review-monthly-recap-july-2025/)). 

One of the annual goal this year for our investment asset is to lower its portion of stock holdings. The shift reverts a little bit in July:

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 33.84% | 
| Funds   | 26.66%           | 
| Cash      | 39.51%         | 

The cash portion declines to 39.51% from 41.80% last month - oscillating around 40 is expected.
