This is the 6th post of the monthly family investment update. The post tracks the performance in the month of June, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

Overall, our family investment asset continues the growth trend started last month. It grows from **108.30** to **113.28** by the end of June, with a positive growth of **2.55%**. The growth tails at that of last month (6.09) and is similar to that of April (2.41).

A breakdown of growth by investment type is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | 2.55            | 
| After tax   | 2.01            | 
| 401(k)      | 4.02            | 

This time the 401(k) portion trumps over the other, although both are behind the market, where S&P index grows at 5.09% and NASDAQ Comp. at 6.64% ([source](https://ccmg.com/benchmark-review-monthly-recap-june-2025/)). 

One of the annual goal this year for our investment asset is to lower its portion of stock holdings. The shift reverts a little bit in May:

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 35.18% | 
| Funds   | 28.93%           | 
| Cash      | 41.80%         | 

The cash portion grows to 41.80% from 37.12% last month. I find the cash position above 40% is a comfortable position for me. I might start investing a bit more into stocks or funds now that I have a little room.
