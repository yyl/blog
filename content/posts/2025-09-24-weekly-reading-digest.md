## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "![](https://images.wsj.net/im-55291615?size=0.667&height=900&pixel_ratio=3)"

2. "By extension, I think that the primary AI interfaces will be something that layers on top of browsers as well, and I think we’re already there: I’m still a chatbot believer! My bet is that chatbots like ChatGPT continue to expand their capabilities and integrations to slowly bleed away what used to be done in the browser, as opposed to AI-enabled browsers capturing new workflows. Yes, the fact that every SaaS app already works in the browser means that browsers have a leg up in terms of integration and context; user behavior and expectations, however, remains the most underrated moat in technology, and I think that new behavior and expectations are more likely to evolve from new paradigms than they are to transform old ones."
   - *Note: Chatbot to replace browser?*

3. "That’s not the only strategy credit YouTube has; while the cost of producing AI-generated video will likely be lower than the cost of producing human-generated video, at least in the long run, the latter’s costs are not borne by TikTok or Meta (Facebook and Instagram are basically video platforms at this point). Rather, the brilliance of the user-generated content model is that creators post their content for free! This, however, means that AI-generated video is actually more expensive, at least if it’s made on TikTok or Meta’s servers. YouTube, however, pays its creators, which means that for the service AI-generated video actually has the potential to lower costs in the long run, increasing the incentive to leverage DeepMind’s industry-leading models."
