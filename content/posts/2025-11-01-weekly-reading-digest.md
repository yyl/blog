## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "The fact of the matter, however, is that Apple’s most important technology — the one architected by Cook himself — is its unmatched capability to make the most sophisticated and profitable devices at astronomical scale, and Apple ultimately does not own and control it: China does."
   - *Note: Same as in Apple in China the book*

2. "while in theory free trade and globalization make supply chains more resilient because you can source from anywhere, in practice free trade has destroyed resiliency."

3. "Amazon, meanwhile, has invested billions of dollars into AWS over the last two decades, making the case that enterprises ought not waste their time and money building out and maintaining their own servers: even if the costs penciled out similarly, the flexibility of being able to scale up and scale down instantly was worth shifting capital costs to operational ones."
   - *Note: Difference between capex and opex*

4. "his mix of 11 herbs and spice"

5. "We were a senior team of ~8 engineers, ~4 researchers, 2 designers, 2 GTM and a PM."
   - *Note: The team that launched codex in 7 weeks from scratch*
