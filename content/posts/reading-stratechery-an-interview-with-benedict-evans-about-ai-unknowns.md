From [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-benedict-evans-about-ai-unknowns/):

> BE: This is a much bigger deal if you’re in the accounting industry than if you’re in the cement industry.

Evans (i.e. BE) is talking about the impact of AI softwares over different industries - huge for accounting industry but little for the cement industry.

The conversation is pertinent to me, as someone works in the tech industry, where AI impact is probably among the most - just look at numerous stories of people using AI coding agents to build working softwares without the help of developers at all. How to survive the wave of AI?

The answer seem to be starting a side business in an industry or sector that are intrinsically resilient towards AI. Now it is probably not feasible for me to get into cement industry, but generally businesses that built around physical goods/locations or people could be promising: physical shop owner, fitness trainer, landlord, blue collar jobs etc. AI is not likely able to replace any of them in the near future. On the contrary, it is possible to even leverage AI to improve the business.
