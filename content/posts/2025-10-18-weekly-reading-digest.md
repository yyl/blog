## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "The average healthy adult needs roughly 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (0.36 grams per pound), according to federal nutrition guidelines. For a 170-pound adult, that breaks down to about 61 grams of protein, which can be achieved by eating a cup of plain Greek yogurt and 3.5 ounces of chicken breast (or 5 ounces of tempeh)."

2. "China [will invest](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-city-leading-chinas-charge-to-pull-ahead-in-ai-de0063ee?mod=article_inline) twice as much as the U.S. this year in power plants, storage and the grid, according to the International Energy Agency. It added about 429 gigawatts of new power generation last year, according to the think tank Climate Energy Finance, while the U.S. built about 50 gigawatt"

3. "**What were the early dynamics here? So you move in, your sophomore year, into this house, is it like, “Hey, I could use some help with the front page web dev”? Was this a thing where you were immediately intrigued or you got roped in? I’m just curious, what’s the dynamics in this house as this idea is forming?**

**DM:** Yeah, path dependence is one of my favorite topics.

**Right. That’s why I’m asking about it. It’s so fascinating.**

**DM:** Yeah, very unintentional. I think the first thing I did to help was set up the email server, which was necessary to send out a confirmation email link."

4. "What Domenicali wants access to are iPhone users; that is increasingly the most important product that Apple is selling."

5. "We treated prompts, context selection settings, and model choices just like any other piece of application code, meaning they had to pass the same automated checks. Every pull request kicked off about 150 canonical queries, which were judged automatically and returned results in under 10 minutes. Once a pull request was merged, the system reran the full suite along with quick smoke checks for latency and cost. If anything crossed a red line, the merge was blocked."

6. "Fast regression tests ran automatically on every pull request, the full suite of curated datasets ran in staging, and live traffic was continuously sampled and scored in production. Dashboards consolidated the results, and that made it easy to see key metrics, pass/fail rates, and shifts over time."

7. "Just as important, we learned that rubrics and judge models themselves need evaluation and iteration. Prompts, instructions, and even the choice of judge model can change outcomes. In some cases, like evaluating specific languages or technical domains, we rely on specialized models to keep scoring fair and accurate. In other words, evaluating the evaluators became part of our own quality loop."
