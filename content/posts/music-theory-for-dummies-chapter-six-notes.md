This chapter finally talks about music staves and how to read them.

* A staff is made of five parallel horizontal lines, with four spaces in between, and is used to hold written notes
* A clef is A symbol placed at the beginning of the staff that defines which pitches the lines and spaces represent
* The treble clef hosts higher-pitched, upper-register notes, mostly for high brass instruments, violin, etc
	* G on the 2nd line, hence G clef
	* All the notes above middle C
* The bass clef hosts lower-pitched notes, mostly for low brass instruments like bassoon and tuba
	* Dots surround 4th line is F below middle C, hence F clef
* Grand staff is when the treble clef and bass clef joined together by middle C

## half steps, whole steps and accidentals

* a music scale usually spans over one octave, which is broken into 12 tones
	* each tone takes up a half step
	* one tone (or semitone), or a half note, is the smallest difference between 2 music notes
* a natural note refers to the basic notes including A, B, C, D, E, F, G
	* they also correspond to all the white keys on a grand piano
* the C major scale happens to consist of exactly the 7 natural notes
* another 5 black keys fill up the rest of tones in the scale
	* originally pianos only have white keys, and black keys are introduced later
* a whole step equals to 2 half steps
* an accidental is a way to temporarily change the pitch of a note out of the key signature
	* sharp: raises the note by a half step
	* flat: lowers the note by a half step
	* natural: cancelling the previous sharp/flat
* an accidental applies to the specific note and notes at the same pitch in the rest of the bar/measure

## memorizing the grand clef

* treble clef
	* notes in the 4 paces between lines: FACE
	* notes on the 5 lines: Every Good Boy Deserves Food
* bass clef
	* notes in the 4 paces between lines: All Cows Eat Grass
	* notes on the 5 lines: Go Buy Donuts For All
