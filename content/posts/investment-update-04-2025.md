This is the 4th post of the monthly family investment update. The post tracks the performance in the month of April, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

Overall, our family investment asset return to growth after 2 months of decline. It was 96.35 at the end of March and 100.47 at the end of April, with a positive growth of 2.44%. A breakdown is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | 2.44            | 
| After tax   | 3.45            | 
| 401(k)      | -0.09           | 

The After tax portion outperforms the 401(k) portion after trailing the latter 2 months in a row. The growth is also better than [that of the S&P Index and that of NASDAQ Comp.](https://ccmg.com/benchmark-review-monthly-recap-april-2025/), which are at -0.68% and 0.88%, respectively. While I don't break down further the asset type, the better-than-index growth is mainly due to a much higher growth of the crypto portion. 

One of the annual goal this year for our investment asset is to lower its portion of stock holdings. There has been a large shift to cash in April:

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 31.20% | 
| Funds   | 24.40%           | 
| Cash      | 42.26%         | 

It grows from 18.08% last month to 42.26%, closing to half. This is largely shifted from individual stocks. The purpose of the shift is managing the risk.
