# 2025 investment wrap up

As a family we have put investment in various places. At the beginning of the 2025 I started tracking the performance of overall and each segment. The table below shows it using an initial value of 100 for each at the start.

| Name        | Performance |
|-------------|-------------|
| Total asset | 103.75      |
| Taxed       | 97.6        |
| Robo-invest | 125.34      |
| 401K        | 118.95      |
| Crypto      | 96.22       |

In the table, 

* `Taxed` segment is basically the active trading account we have with our taxed money - it roughly split in 3 ways into individual stocks, mutual funds and cash (t-bills and money market funds). 
* `Robo-invest` refers to the portion managed by automatic trading companies
* `401K` refers to our tax-exempt funds, which almost exclusively in various index funds
* `Crypto` refers to the portion invested in crypto currencies like Bitcoin

To understand what each number means, take first row as an example: it means our total asset grows only a measly 3.75% this year, and others follow. As a reference, the US S&P 500 stock index [grows 17.9% in 2025](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2026/1/8/the-sp-500-index-2025-recap).

## Takeaway 1: we suck at trading

If there is only one takeaway, it is we should stop trading ourselves.

`Taxed` is the worst segment (except `Crypto` - more on that below) with a negative return of 2.4%. It is also the only active trading segment - none of the rest requires any management from us. What’s even worse is that ~2/3 of `Taxed` are either cash (providing stable low positive returns) or funds (also providing positive returns this year). It means the remaining ~1/3 that is in individual stock trading performs much worse than -2.4%. We are actively do stuff to throw away money!

It sounds dumb to learn this the hard way when it is a well-known knowledge: people usually can’t beat the market. Our immediate action is to stop stock picking and move taxed money into other segments entirely.

## Takeaway 2: robo-invest is not bad

The `robo-invest` segment surprisingly beat the market (S&P 500). Its 0.25% advisory fee can be substantial, but might be justified by the return. For the new year we might invest a bit more there. 

## Takeaway 3: treat crypto like it’s gone

Crypto trading market in general has a volatile year - it dipped to new lows, hiked to new highs and then dipped to newer lows. This year we are managed to hold it still with zero activity, so we skipped both the highs and lows (well we are still in the relatively low point as we speak). 

I do feel like holding crypto and do not trade much is the strategy if one sees its long term potential, which we do. We also treat it as if some day it can also go to zero, and we are fine with it. 

This way saves a lot of headache because crypto prices are so volatile and it moves 24/7, aka no market closure. This will be our strategy in new year still.

## End

Tracking the investment monthly in 2025 has been useful, though I haven’t really written everything happened there. Since the new year strategy now shifts to almost entirely passive, tracking monthly seems unnecessary, so I will track it quarterly.
