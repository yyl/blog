I add a subscribe form so that whoever interested can subscribe to my new post and receive them via email. The form is at the end of every post:

The service I use is called [follow.it](https://follow.it). Its free-tier is quite generous e.g. can only support up to 5 different feeds. For me it's more than generous. 

The email looks ok on a desktop:

But less so on a mobile phone:

It looks a bit crammed - but since it is free, it's a decent starting point!
