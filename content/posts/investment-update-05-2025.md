This is the 5th post of the monthly family investment update. The post tracks the performance in the month of May, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

Overall, our family investment asset continues the growth trend started last month. It was **100.47** at the end of last month and **108.30** at the end of this month, with a positive growth of **6.09%**. The total value finally climbs over the previous peak (104.85 at the end of January). May has also been the month with the highest growth so far. 

A breakdown of growth by investment type is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | 6.09            | 
| After tax   | 6.32            | 
| 401(k)      | 5.46            | 

The After tax portion outperforms the 401(k) portion again this month. The overall growth trails both that of S&P index (6.29%) and NASDAQ Comp. (9.65%) ([source](https://ccmg.com/benchmark-review-monthly-recap-may-2025/)). 

One of the annual goal this year for our investment asset is to lower its portion of stock holdings. The shift reverts a little bit in May:

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 39.07% | 
| Funds   | 26.39%           | 
| Cash      | 37.12%         | 

The cash portion declines from 42.26% to 37.12%. This is mostly due to a increase of investment in both individual stocks and funds. Overall I'm still comfortable with the ratio.
