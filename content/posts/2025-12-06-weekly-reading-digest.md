## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "The OECD’s growth outlook points out that US GDP growth is now flat if you exclude data centre construction. Generative AI is effectively a private stimulus programme, funded mostly by advertising (and now debt)."

2. "Because I think people always think we need the iPhone 17 Air, we need to keep innovating. And look, sometimes people just want to come home from a hard day at work, put on Friends or Seinfeld, sit back with a beer and laugh and watch something they’ve watched 30 times. I just think that no one is running the old version of Windows, we don’t do that, we just want the newest latest thing."
   - *Note: Tech people don’t understand normies just want the old and familiar stuff*

3. "When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things."

4. "What the brothers realized early on was that distribution just wasn’t a very good business: you had to maintain the theater and find films to show, and your profit was capped by your capacity, which you had to work diligently to fill out; after all, every empty seat in a showing was potential revenue that disappeared forever. What was far more lucrative was making the films shown in those theaters: you could film a movie once and make money on it again and again."
   - *Note: Don’t be the distribution business*
