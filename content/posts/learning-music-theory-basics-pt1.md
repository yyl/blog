Recently I have started learning some very basic music theory while also learning to play a digital keyboard. I add some more details of motivation at the bottom. Below is what I have learned so far.

- A **note** defines the unit of a sound in music, and can be a letter ranging from A to G
- A **measure** or **bar** is like a bounded space for a bunch of notes
- A **time signature** determines the number of notes of specific types can be in a measure or a bar
- A **whole/half/quarter** note takes up one measure in a typical 4/4 time signature (4 beats)
- An **octave** defines the interval between two notes where one having twice the frequency of vibration of the other 
- A **scale** is just the sequence of notes that are between one note and its octave
- A **major scale** is a type of scale defined by the intervals between notes
	- 2 notes can be either whole or half step away from each other
	- major scale has an interval pattern of `Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half`
	- major scales tend to sound bright, happy and hopeful
- A **C major scale** starts at a C note, goes to D, E, F, G, A, B and ends at C in the next octave
- A **minor scale** follows the pattern of `Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole`
- A **chord** is a combination of three or more musical tones sounded simultaneously to create a harmonic effect
- Chord examples: C major chord, A minor chord
