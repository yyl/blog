This is the 2nd post of the monthly update of our family investment asset. The post tracks the performance in the month of February, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

Overall, our family investment asset shrinks in February. It was 104.85 in January but 102.08 at the end of the February, with a negative growth of -3.47%. A breakdown is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | -3.47           | 
| After tax   | -4.35           | 
| 401(k)      | -0.82           | 

It's easy to see that the 401(k) portion performs better than the after tax portion, relatively. If we zoom out, the S&P Index [fell 1.3% in the February](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/details/february-2025-market-commentary/#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20Index%20fell%201.3,Growth%20Index%20fell%203.6%20percent.&text=Performance%20among%20larger%20capitalization%20and,high%20beta18%20stocks%20lagged..), while Nasdaq-100 Index [fell 2.7%](https://www.invesco.com/apac/en/institutional/insights/etf/nasdaq-100-Index-commentary-february-2025.html). The after tax portion consists of a large percentage of individual stocks, mostly in the growth sector (tech, telecommunication), so it tracks more like Nasdaq-100 index. The 401(k) portion consists about half in SP500 index fund and half in retirement fund, so tracks more like a smooth-over SP500. 

As mentioned in the first post, the after tax portion is undergoing a reallocation from individual stocks to index funds. Here's the ratio breakdown of the after tax portion as of the end of the February:

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 64.84 | 
| Funds   | 24.59           | 
| Cash      | 10.57         |
