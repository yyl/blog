This blog has a set of posts that are [automatically generated by code runs in the cloud to track my weekly reading]({{< ref "generating-weekly-reading-digest-automatically.md" >}}). Each post contains a list of articles read. When the list goes too long, the post looks like being dragged and not very readable. I'd also like to be able to sort the list by title, or the count of words per article. 

To solve both problems, I've added an interactive table to display the list of articles read in each post like this:

It is more compact and has a structure, hopefully making the list more readable. It also allows one to sort the list by one of the columns.

Adding it is straightforward:

1. Change the digest generator code to format the list into a table in markdown format
2. Find a Javascript library that makes HTML tables sortable and add it to each post
3. Add a Javascript code snippet to each post to use the library to make the table sortable

The challenge for me is to find out where to add the library. I use Hugo to generate my website. The way how Hugo sites work is that usually files under `/layouts` defines how the HTML pages look. Specifically, `/layouts/partials/footer.html` has elements that are usually placed after `</body>` tag, such as `<footer>` and Javascript code. This should be where the code lies in. [This file from my Github](https://github.com/yyl/blog/blob/main/layouts/partials/footer.html) has the code I put in for my blog.

Once the code is in, all tables on the site get converted into interactive tables that can be sorted by columns! Some tweaks on the CSS might be needed depending on the website design.
