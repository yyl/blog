[This interview](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-michael-nathanson-about-the-streaming-endgame/) goes through a lot of things through the lens of Michael Nathanson, from streaming players, sports industry, to tech industry:

1. **Youtube TV** from Alphabet has the best potential among all streaming players (Peacock, Paramount Plus, Netflix) because:

- It is the only player that has all channels content including that from other streaming players, paid TV channels and exclusive user generated content
- Its parent company, Google, is best at the advertising game among all players

2. **Peacock** is an interesting player because it has 3 very popular assets: NBC sports, NBC news and Bravo - all essential to a typical household

- However their business model is poor because it is under-priced

> MN: In this industry, I can’t blame Peacock because Paramount did it. If you look at the original, the Disney Plus launch way back in 2019, that was exceptionally cheap. They all failed to raise prices during the pandemic the way Netflix did because it was an essential good, it was like selling a mask. You’re stuck at home, you have to watch something, we’re going to raise prices. If they’re too slow to raise prices, therefore they create deflation within the entertainment channel.

3. **Netflix** has the best leverage in terms of content spending

- Having the largest subscribe base gives them the [best buying and pricing power]({{< ref "stratechery-netflix-earnings-q4-24.md" >}})
- Sports events are indeed driving new subscriber signups even if they denied so, because they are buying more sports events: "don’t judge them by what they say, judge them by what they do."
- They buy sports events when there is value but they don't depend on those to survive



Tech companies spending like a media company
