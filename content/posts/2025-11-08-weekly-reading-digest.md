## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "People are going to have a lot of different type of leverage in their conversation with ChatGPT. So Shopify and their couple of hundred billion dollars of GMV, and Walmart hundreds of billions of dollars of GMV, and Amazon hundreds of billions. But Etsy, with like 10, and some of the smaller players, they’re going to be more at the mercy, and ChatGPT is going to know, “Hey, this is incremental demand for you”. So totally, yeah. Walmart doesn’t need to take Apple Pay, and they’re going to be able to play hard ball with ChatGPT, and so is Amazon."

2. "“Look, search is traditionally, everybody, if you go talk to people on search, they read academic papers on search, they’re very focused on keywords, it’s not built around product, and product search is different”, and why the models are so much better — and because look, Google looks at it and they’re like, “Okay, this person’s bidding X amount for that impression, and if we look at their website, they get Y level of traffic and Z amount of conversion, that must mean it’s good, we’ll weight that bid”, because it’s not just the highest bid always wins, there’s a lot of other influencing factors that makes a bid stronger."
   - *Note: Search is not for product = semantic search sucks?*
