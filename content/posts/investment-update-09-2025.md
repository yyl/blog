I'm very much behind on the investment update - here's the September update. The post tracks the performance in the month of September, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

As mentioned in the [H1 retrospect]({{< ref "investment-retrospect-h1-2025.md" >}}), the new metric records the investment performance of this month from **104.40** to **108.78**. As a reference, SP500 index grows 15.47% this year so far.

A breakdown of growth by investment type is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | 4.20            | 
| After tax   | 4.59            | 
| 401(k)      | 3.14            | 

It's a less common situation when the after tax portion outperforms the counterpart. When it does, it is usually because the crypto portion boosts the former. This month is the same story, where our crypto assets grew 10.26%. As a reference, S&P index grows at 3.65% and NASDAQ Comp. at 5.68% ([source](https://ccmg.com/benchmark-review-monthly-recap-september-2025/)). 

Our current asset holdings distribution:

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 35.98% | 
| Funds   | 26.61%           | 
| Cash      | 37.41%         | 

What happens is I think the market is doing very well, which drives me to buy a little bit more stocks - both contributing to the growth rate and the stocks ratio.
