## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be."
   - *Note: Apple seems to be more suitable for this. What advantages do Meta have to build this instead of others?*

2. "Implicit in this observation is the fact that I don’t think that human content is going anywhere; there just might be a smaller percentage of time devoted to it, and that’s a problem for a company predicated on marshaling attention."

3. "A popular strategy for bootstrapping networks is what I like to call “come for the tool, stay for the network.” The idea is to initially attract users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company."
   - *Note: Network and discovery always come later. But what if the network already exists from a previous tool?*

4. "If this is more like graphics, then this goes for a long time and I think Jensen would agree more with that. This is the whole reason he’s pivoted the GPU to these workloads, is because they’re very much like graphics and that’s just an era of software. It won’t be all software, but let’s say the big software houses who build this will build that compute and that reality — I think that’s where, if you believe that, that angle of viewing software, this goes on for much longer than people think."
   - *Note: This sounds more likely*

5. "If you look at a lot of the research papers, there is trending breakthroughs towards these small micro-reactors which could fuel one or two of these. If that happens, that’s productive. You could use that for cities like you said in some other areas, so it’s forcing this innovation function, that’s what’s happening."
   - *Note: Who has this?oklo?*

6. "**Are we going to face a scenario where general cloud computing actually starts to get more expensive because CPUs are being torn out for GPUs and so there’s more competition for the CPUs that remain?**

**BB:** I believe it’s trending in that direction. I even believe the CPUs that are needed to run agentic AI in a cloud, just cloud-native workloads actually will become more expensive."
   - *Note: What's the implications? Better for cloud provider?*

7. "However, if you clicked into energy costs, that’s because gas was down significantly and electricity was up a lot, and it has actually been up report after report after report. Is this directly applicable to AI? Electricity costs are skyrocketing all over the country, and it’s just a matter of you have these build outs that have guaranteed contracts, and so consumers are the ones actually bearing the costs her"
   - *Note: How has the electricity bill trend over time? Another motivation for solar panel? And gas has been down?*

8. "“If I know somebody has 5 gigawatts of power total, or 10 gigawatt or whatever, you can get a sense of what their upside is just in revenue to monetize that in tokens”, and I’m making that point that that’s an AI factory state point."
   - *Note: What's the power of a typical factory then*
