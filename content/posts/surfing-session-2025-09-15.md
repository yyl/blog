Forecast:
> Fresh, short to mid period WNW swell fills in, with fun waves running knee-stomach-chest high range. The shorter period will help with shape (peakier) and the manageable onshore wind this afternoon will coincide with a fuller tide, which should also help with shape.
> 
> Light+ W onshores for the afternoon.

Condition:

Notes:

+ Surfed near the Taco Bell at Linda Mar from 9:40 to 11:20
	+ Looks like my stamina runs out after about 2 hours of surfing
	+ I was mostly between the Taco Bell and the north shower station
+ Wave height goes from 3-4ft at 9am to 2-3ft at 12pm
	+ This time I was fighting mostly 3-4ft waves
+ Primary swell ~5.5ft @ 8s at WNW direction
	+ I couldn't really tell the difference of swell directions yet
	+ 8s is frequent but waves are still quite powerful
+ Wind goes from Offshore 3/3 E to cross-shore 2/3 NE
	+ Wind is quite light I almost didn't feel anything
+ Wave energy 240kJ to 305J: powerful powerful waves

Ok this time waves are brutal and they gave me quite a rough time. First of all, I go to the same beach as last time - Pacifica State Beach at Linda Mar. However its coastline is actually quite long - see the complete coastline below.

Last time (8/11) I was to the south of the San Pedro valley, and this time (9/15) I am between the Taco Bell and the Restroom. Their surfing conditions are very different. The general consensus is that south side is more beginner-friendly, and the north is mostly for the advanced. I can certainly agree!

The south side for sure suits my level much better, but its water quality is usually pretty bad. Today happens to be the case so I figure to give the north side a try - it usually is cleaner. I guess that's a lesson learned - don't go out of your league!

So the waves at north side are brutal - frequent and also powerful. Paddling over these waves is definitely challenging - I've been beaten back many times. People with shorter boards can typically duck dive, meaning they will dive under the water when waves hit, by pushing the board under. The foam longboard that I use is too "buoyant" to be pushed under, so the only way I go is to paddle against the wave - but that works well only for smaller waves. If a 3-4ft wave peaks in front of me, it would either beat me down or wash me out completely. 

When I did get to the deeper area, I was able to catch maybe 5-6 waves. Unfortunately for most of them I wasn't able to really surf the whole wave. The waves are simply too big for me. The usual pattern is, when I catch the wave, I stand up, then I fall from the surface of the wave to the bottom of it, and lose the speed. Because the waves are big it's difficult to maintain the balance when falling to the bottom so at that point I sometimes just fall out. If I survive that, I usually get caught up again by the wave and it is so powerful and it washes me out. Remember the last time I don't feel the waves are as big as advertised? Now I know why - likely it is because south side has smaller waves, and this time I get to experience 3-4ft waves.

Overall this is a tough session - waves are too powerful for me to really catch and ride.
