## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "Gossip from the Information that OpenAI optimised model development for benchmarks that focused on complex and obscure maths and scientific puzzles, and was then surprised that those don’t map well to normal consumer use cases. This puzzles me. I have always thought of benchmarks as trying to say something about underlying conceptual capabilities (and of course in how much they’re being gamed). I didn’t realise that the people who work on them would think users really wanted a model that can do the actual tasks in the evals."

2. "These systems have correlation across SKUs, and down the funnel, but they don’t know why, just as a dog knows that the sound of door keys has high correlation with a walk, but doesn’t know what keys are."
