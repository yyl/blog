## Highlights from the Past Week

1. "Indeed, the real question for OpenAI is if they are in fact the `4o` model as a company: just a bit too obsequious and sycophantic. The paradox of successful consumer companies from Apple to Facebook is that they *give* customers what they want, but they don’t *ask* them; they make decisions and then seek out revealed preference through data, not stated preference on social media. Hopefully OpenAI did that in this case; my concern is that the more realistic explanation is that this is a company that, in the end, can’t say “no” to anyone."

2. "> So on your first question about impression growth, the worldwide impression growth acceleration that we saw in Q2 was driven primarily by incremental engagement on video and Feed surfaces, which benefited from a bunch of the ranking optimizations that we made to our content recommendations on Facebook and Instagram, and then to a lesser extent some of the ad load optimizations.

It turns out I was right last quarter that Meta had a lot of room to increase Reels monetization, but not just because they could target ads better (that was a part of it, as I noted above): rather, it turns out that short-form video is so addictive that Meta can simply drive more engagement — and thus more ad inventory — by pushing more of it. That’s impression driver number one — and the most important one. The second one is even more explicit: Meta simply started showing more ads to people (i.e. “ad load optimization”)."
