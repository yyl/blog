This is the 3rd post of the monthly family investment update. The post tracks the performance in the month of March, 2025. [The first post]({{< ref "investment-update-01-2025.md" >}}) contains some explanation of why and how we are doing this. 

Overall, our family investment asset shrinks in March, a 2nd time in a row. It was 102.08 in Feb and 96.35 at the end of March, with a negative growth of -7.96%. A breakdown is as follows:

| Name        | Growth rate (%) | 
| ----------- | -------         | 
| Total asset | -7.96           | 
| After tax   | -9.52           | 
| 401(k)      | -3.49           | 

The 401(k) portion still performs better than the after tax portion, relatively. However, the decrease in asset value is even worse than that in February. Zoom out, the S&P Index [fell 5.63% in March](https://ccmg.com/benchmark-review-monthly-recap-march-2025/), and Nasdaq a whopping -8.14%. 

One of the annual goal this year for our investment asset is to lower its portion of stock holdings. As shown below, it's slowly moving towards the goal. 

| Name        | Ratio (%)   | 
| ----------- | -------     | 
| Individual stocks | 52.67 | 
| Funds   | 23.78           | 
| Cash      | 18.08         | 

Compared to that in last month, cash percentage grows from 10.57 to 18.08, and individual stocks are down to 52.67 from 64.84. Note a large portion of funds is also in the stock index funds - the goal is to be less exposed to individual stocks, not the stock market per se. That being said, with all the tariffs news going around, it might not be a good time to keep the index funds either.
