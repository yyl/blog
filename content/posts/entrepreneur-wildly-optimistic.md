Quick thought: Entrepreneurship, at its core, requires wild optimism.

The thought struck me while watching an interview with a tech executive explaining why their latest product launch failed and received overwhelmingly negative reviews. The details of the failure weren’t what stood out—instead, it was the optimistic tone the executive used while reflecting on the situation.

In this context, optimism simply means having the willingness to try and the confidence that it will succeed. The opposite would be seeing all the challenges and deciding it will fail before even attempting it.

That interview reminded me of the conversations, interviews, and podcasts I’ve listened to about how people start and grow their businesses. A common thread is how deeply these founders believe in their vision and pour everything into it—especially when things get tough (like running out of money, facing lawsuits, or other crises). Many describe how they just kept going until something finally clicked. Of course, for every success story, there are many that don’t make it. Still, this kind of radical optimism seems essential—it helps people see past immediate obstacles and stay focused on the possibility of future success.

Another recurring theme is how naive and overly optimistic people often are when they first start a business. Many say they had no idea how hard it would be—and admit that, had they known, they might not have done it at all. That initial optimism seems to serve as a kind of fuel, propelling them past the early barriers and toward the “rainbow” they believe is just ahead.

Call it faith, vision, ambition—or maybe just delusion—but at the heart of entrepreneurship is a bold optimism about the future. It’s what drives people to do things others wouldn’t dare or even understand—for better or worse.
