Forecast:

> Surf holds on NW swell. Spots outside of Linda Mar see fresh SSW swell move into exposed areas.
>
> NW swell mix continues, for knee-thigh-waist high surf, with north end spots seeing the most size this afternoon. Light winds mid-day, turning low-end moderate W-WNW onshore for the afternoon.
>
> Well exposed breaks outside of Linda Mar will see a new run of long-period SSW swell fill in, for fun waves this afternoon.

Notes:

+ Surfed at Princeton Jetty from 9:30 to 11:30
+ Wave height 1-2ft, and forecast says "knee-thigh-waist high": this undersells a bit because some waves today are waist to chest
	+ Waves are even higher closer to the jetty (further from the sand beach)
+ Primary swell ~1.5ft @ 18s: the period sounds about right, it's not too frequent, giving me sufficient break between waves
+ Wind goes from Onshore 4/4 SW to Onshore 1/1 WNW: wind is indeed light throughout the time
+ Wave energy ~65kJ: I got washed a few times and the waves feel strong
	+ it was ~100kJ a day before so maybe got updated
	
This is my first time at Princeton Jetty so the whole time I was mostly just trying to get familiar with the wave rhythm. There are too many times either my spot is earlier or later than I thought in terms of riding the wave top, so I got washed quite frequently. I've surfed in a few spots but this feels just different - somehow the wave gets up very slowly but then drops super quick, which messed up my readings for sure. I caught the wave a few times but overall it was quite messy. Maybe because it's a jetty that creates backwash when the waves hit the rocks, there are times waves are coming from all the directions - they are small but I can see and feel it. This makes the condition even less clearer when it happens. 

The beach is also more crowded than I thought - loads of surf schools/camps (maybe it's summer?). But fortunately it has long enough stretch for takeoff it was not that bad. I mostly stayed out of the actual jetty area. It was small so already quite occupied, also waves there are bigger so I decided to learn more before I go in there.

Overall this size and power of the waves I think is good enough for beginners like me, and the light wind feels great.
